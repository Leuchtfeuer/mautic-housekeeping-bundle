Command to delete lead_event_log, campaign_lead_event_log, email_stats and email_stats_devices table entries.

```
By default, entries older than 365 days are deleted from the CampaignLeadEventLog, LeadEventLog, EmailStats and EmailStatsDevices tables.
### Parameter
```
-d  | --days-old      | Specifies the minimum age of the entries to be deleted. Default: 365 days
-r  | --dry-run       | Execute as dry run. No entries will be deleted
-i  | --cmp-id        | Delete only data for a specific campaign ID from campaign_lead_event_log
-c  | --campaign-lead | Only entries from the campaign_lead_event_log table will be deleted

### Installation
- Plugin must be saved under plugins/MauticHouskeepingBundle/ 

- Afterwards, the cache must be cleared.


## Notice
- Every last entry from the campaign_lead_event_log per campaign will be kept. This is due to contacts restarting campaigns if there is no last step preserved in the log.
