# Housekeeping by Leuchtfeuer
This plugin provides a Mautic Housekeeping Command for database cleanup purposes.

## Command
Command to delete lead_event_log table entries, campaign_lead_event_log table entries, email_stats table entries where the referenced email entry is currently not published and email_stats_devices table entries.

Important: If referenced email is ever switched back to published, the contacts will get the email again.

```
bin/console mautic:leuchtfeuer:housekeeping
```
By default, entries older than 365 days are deleted from the CampaignLeadEventLog, LeadEventLog, EmailStats (only email_stats entries that referenced emails entry is currently not published) and EmailStatsDevices tables.

### Parameter
```
-d  | --days-old                | Specifies the minimum age of the entries to be deleted. Default: 365 days
-r  | --dry-run                 | Execute as dry run. No entries will be deleted
-i  | --cmp-id                  | Delete only data for a specific campaign ID from campaign_lead_event_log
-c  | --campaign-lead           | Only entries from the campaign_lead_event_log table will be deleted
-m  | --email-stats             | Only entries from the email_stats table where the referenced email entry is currently not published and from the email_stats_devices table will be deleted.
-t  | --email-stats-tokens      | Set only tokens fields in Email Stats Records to NULL. Important: This option can not be combined with any "-c", "-l" or "-m" flag in one command. And: If the option flag "-t" is not set, the NULL setting of tokens will not be done with the basis command, so if you just run mautic:leuchtfeuer:housekeeping without a flag.
-l  | --lead                    | Only entries from the lead_event_log table will be deleted.
```

### Installation
- Plugin must be saved under plugins/MauticHousekeepingBundle/
- Afterwards, the cache must be cleared.

### Notice
- Every last entry from the campaign_lead_event_log per campaign will be kept. This is due to contacts restarting campaigns if there is no last step preserved in the log. 

### Known issues
- A `--dry-run` might fail on databases with a huge amount of entries.
